# OOP with TypeScript 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript works similarly to other OOP languages, but with the added benefit of static types. 
TypeScript provides features like classes, inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Let's explore each OOP concept with examples.

### classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It can have properties and methods.

```ts 
class Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet(): string {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(person1.greet());
```

### âœ… Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

``` ts 
class Employee extends Person {
    employeeId: number;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, employeeId: number) {
        super(name, age); // Calls the parent class constructor
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
    }

    showEmployeeDetails(): string {
        return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old and has employee ID: ${this.employeeId}`;
    }
}

const emp = new Employee("Bob", 25, 12345);
console.log(emp.showEmployeeDetails());

```

### âœ… Encapsulation

Encapsulation restricts direct access to the properties of a class. This is done using access modifiers:

`public:` Accessible from anywhere.

`private:` Accessible only within the class.

`protected:` Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

``` ts 
class BankAccount {
    private balance: number;

    constructor(initialBalance: number) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    deposit(amount: number): void {
        this.balance += amount;
    }

    getBalance(): number {
        return this.balance;
    }
}

const myAccount = new BankAccount(1000);
myAccount.deposit(500);
console.log(myAccount.getBalance()); // 1500


```

### âœ… Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It can be achieved through method overriding.

``` ts 
class Animal {
    sound(): string {
        return "Some sound";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    sound(): string {
        return "Bark";
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    sound(): string {
        return "Meow";
    }
}

function makeSound(animal: Animal) {
    console.log(animal.sound());
}

const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

makeSound(dog);  // Output: Bark
makeSound(cat);  // Output: Meow

```

### âœ… Abstract Classes

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may have abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.

``` ts 
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract drive(): void;

    startEngine(): void {
        console.log("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    drive(): void {
        console.log("Driving the car...");
    }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.startEngine();  // Engine started
myCar.drive();        // Driving the car...
```


### âœ… Interfaces

Interfaces define the structure of an object, which can then be implemented by classes. Interfaces can also be extended.

``` ts 
interface IEmployee {
    employeeId: number;
    name: string;
    getDetails(): string;
}

class Manager implements IEmployee {
    employeeId: number;
    name: string;
    department: string;

    constructor(employeeId: number, name: string, department: string) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
    }

    getDetails(): string {
        return `${this.name} (ID: ${this.employeeId}) manages the ${this.department} department.`;
    }
}

const manager = new Manager(1001, "Alice", "IT");
console.log(manager.getDetails());
```

### âœ… Getters and Setters
You can use getters and setters to control how properties are accessed and modified.



``` ts 
class User {
    private _password: string = "default";

    get password(): string {
        return this._password.replace(/./g, "*");  // Return masked password
    }

    set password(newPassword: string) {
        if (newPassword.length > 6) {
            this._password = newPassword;
        } else {
            console.log("Password must be longer than 6 characters");
        }
    }
}

const user = new User();
console.log(user.password);  // Output: *******

user.password = "123";       // Password too short
user.password = "newPassword123";  // Sets the new password
console.log(user.password);   // Output: **************

```

## Summary of OOP Concepts in TypeScript ðŸ’¡:
- `Classes:` Blueprints for creating objects with properties and methods.

- `Inheritance:` A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.

- `Encapsulation:` Use public, private, and protected to restrict access to class members.

- `Polymorphism:` Allows subclasses to be treated as instances of the parent class.

- `Interfaces:` Define the structure that classes must implement.

- `Abstract Classes:` Cannot be instantiated and can contain abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses.

- `Getters and Setters:` Control how properties are accessed and mutated.
