## 1. What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to JavaScript.
- Files have the extension .ts.
TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all JavaScript environments.

## 2. Why Use TypeScript?

- Type Safety: Detects errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
- Improved IDE Support: Provides better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring tools.
- Optional Static Typing: You can gradually add typing to existing JavaScript code.
Object-Oriented Programming: Supports OOP principles like interfaces, classes, and inheritance.
